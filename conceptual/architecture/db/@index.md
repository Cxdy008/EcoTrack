# Case Study
****
Somewhere in the city of Luanda, in a given municipality, the local administration has been facing major difficulties in controlling and managing the collection of urban solid waste.

Currently, there is no system that centralizes information about the collection trucks, the responsible employees, the collection points, and the routes taken, which causes disorganization, increased costs, and delays in street cleaning.

Garbage trucks circulate without defined routes and often repeat routes, leaving other areas unattended. There is also no precise record of their operational data, such as registration number, model, maximum capacity, average fuel consumption, and maintenance status.

Similarly, employees—drivers, collectors, and supervisors—are managed manually, without clear control of their names, contacts, emails, addresses, and functions performed, which hinders the efficient allocation of teams.

The collection points scattered throughout the neighborhoods are also not properly monitored. The exact address, zone, predominant type of waste (domestic, industrial, hospital, etc.) and the ideal collection frequency for each location are unknown.

Furthermore, there are no detailed records of the collections carried out, such as date, time, truck used, amount of waste collected, fuel consumed, and the employees involved in each operation.

Collection routes are defined empirically, without a basis in concrete data, and this causes some trucks to travel very long distances while others are underutilized.

As a consequence, there are streets with accumulated garbage, increased fuel consumption, and failures in the time management of the teams.

Without a tool that integrates all this information, the administration has faced a slow, inefficient, and expensive management process, with a direct impact on the quality of life of citizens and the environmental sustainability of the region.
